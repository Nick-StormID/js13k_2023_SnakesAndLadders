## Game
- Originally invented in 13th Century India as a game to teach children about the virtues and vices of life.
- Two player game - Human vs Bot.
- The Human goes first, clicking the dice to play.
- Entirely a game of chance (although apparently player 1 has a just better than 50% chance of winning on average)
## Technical Approach
- All graphics, including the HTML background used for the dice, drawn with code
- Graphic shapes (eg snakes) as well as movement controlled with easing calculations
- Added simple sound with the HTML Audio API
- Vanilla JavaScript
